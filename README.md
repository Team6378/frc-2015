Container Sequence:
1) when container upright (claw has to be up)
2) back away
3) bring claw down all the way to bottom (open)
4) get container (may not have to do anything with clapper)
5) once container hits open claw, up to container rim, and then clap the container
6) lift contianer more (8-10 in) until claw at bottom of container
7) close claw, release clapper, lift claw up

**anytime you lift the claw past the hook, the ratchet hook must be pulled back**
**check low enc rate logic*
